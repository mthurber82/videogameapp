## Description
Our mission is to create an app meant for game research purposes rather then for purchase options. The gaming community is spread far and wide and it was our job to consolidate all games for the convenience of the user. When using GameGo you can search by genre, console, and the number of players. As a user you will be provided with a library of games based on your criteria giving you game ratings as well as a link to watch the gameplay on Youtube.

## Project Use Cases

As a user, I can search for games based on Platform, Genre, and Player requirements.
